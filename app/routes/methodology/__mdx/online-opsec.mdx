Staying invisible online is a lot of work. And most of the time you don't need to.

Similar to [Jeff Cooper's Color Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Cooper#Combat_mindset_and_the_Cooper_color_code), I brooke my level of security based on the situation.

1. <span className="bg-white  text-gray-900 px-1">White</span> - Casual web activity
2. <span className="bg-yellow-500 shade px-1">Yellow</span> - Doing research
3. <span className="bg-orange-500 shade px-1">Orange</span> - Threat Hunting
4. <span className="bg-black shade px-1">Midnight</span> - Shenanigans

If you are casually using the internet, you want to optimize for speed of use. Most of the measure we'll take for high level of security will just slow you down.

1. Use a reasonably hardened machine
2. Use a password manager
3. Favor Brave
4. Use seperate profiles for sensitive activities (e.g. crypto, banking, etc)

## <span className="bg-yellow-500 shade px-1">Yellow</span> - Doing research

This is ideal for security research. You may leak some personal details but we're guarding somewhate. Layer everything from above.

1. Daily driver is fine
2. VPN
3. Isolated profiles for hutning without your personal accounts logged in

## <span className="bg-orange-500 shade px-1">Orange</span> - Threat Hunting

This is ideal for threat hunting. I'm assuming everyting you're doing here is in Scope and above board. The big difference is we're wanting to obscure our identity and create layers between you and your Layer everything from above.

1. Clean Room PC(tm) running Kali on VMware
2. Clean Room PC is running VPN
3. Kali is running another VPN
4. (optoinal) Kali is running proxy chains
